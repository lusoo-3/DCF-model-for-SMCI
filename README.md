# Financial equity research 
This project aims to simplify the equity research process by using Python to automate and enhance stock analysis. The goal is to build a self-developed equity valuation model, starting from traditional financial methods and gradually integrating AI-driven approaches to improve efficiency and analytical depth.
As I am still a beginner in financial services, this repository will also include a detailed explanation of all financial metrics used, making it both a practical tool and a personal learning journey.
The whole stock framework will be divided into four systems: Financial analysis systems\ Comparable systems\ Valuation systems\ and price decision systems
# The financial analysis systems 
It will rely on the traditional financial metrics, such as revenue... to discover the business model and the exact situation of the company.
# The comparable systems:
The comparable systems: after choosing the opponents of your company, this system will automatically produce a comparison between these companies by using the dimensions you use.
# The valuation system:
Automatically build a DCF model and produce a fair stock price. Also, use sensitivity analysis for validation.
# The price decision systems
Using machine learning methods to find out the best price to buy and the return in the future.
